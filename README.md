# 🧠 Sentiment Analyzer (Mini NLP Project)

This is a beginner-friendly sentiment analyzer built using Python and TextBlob. It checks if a sentence expresses a positive, negative, or neutral emotion.

## 🌟 Why I Built This

I created this project while exploring the basics of NLP. I'm fascinated by how AI understands human language, and this was a great way to see how machines can interpret emotions from text.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Input a sentence
- It analyzes sentiment using TextBlob
- Outputs the overall mood (Positive, Negative, or Neutral)

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python
- TextBlob
- Google Colab

## 👨‍💻 Try It

You can open, save a copy of the file in drive and run the `.ipynb` notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18lWXwAwktT27Q9qZj8vP0Q4SXEYK_W79?usp=sharing).
