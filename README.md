# 🧠 Sentiment Analyzer (Mini NLP Project)

This is a beginner-friendly sentiment analyzer built using Python and TextBlob. It checks if a sentence expresses a positive, negative, or neutral emotion.

## 🌟 Why I Built This

I built this simple sentiment analyzer to explore the basics of Natural Language Processing (NLP). Companies often need to understand how people feel about their products or services through tweets, reviews, and feedback. Media houses also use similar tools to track public reactions. This project shows how we can use AI to detect emotions in text — something that first drew me to NLP.

It helped me understand how machines can interpret human emotions, and how these small building blocks lead to larger AI systems used in opinion mining, customer support, and online safety. It’s a small but meaningful step toward understanding real-world applications of AI.

## ⚙️ How It Works

- Input a sentence
- It analyzes sentiment using TextBlob
- Outputs the overall mood (Positive, Negative, or Neutral)

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python
- TextBlob
- Google Colab

## 👨‍💻 Try It

You can open, save a copy of the file in drive and run the `.ipynb` notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18lWXwAwktT27Q9qZj8vP0Q4SXEYK_W79?usp=sharing).
